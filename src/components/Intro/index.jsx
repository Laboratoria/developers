    <h2>Laboratoria Devs Chapter</h2>
    <p>
      We are <strong>a community made up of all the developers working at&nbsp;
      <a href="https://www.laboratoria.la/">Laboratoria</a></strong>. That
      includes any Laboratorian that identifies as a developer, independent of
      their day-to-day role.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DevsChapter's <strong>main goal is to promote peer learning, sharing
      and cross-pollination across teams</strong>. The community has a bunch
      of resources to enable collaboration, sharing and support among devs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DevsChapter also serves the purpose of providing <strong>design,
      implementation and collaboration guidelines</strong>.
